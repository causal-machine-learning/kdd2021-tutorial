# **Causal Inference and Machine Learning in Practice**: Use cases for Product, Brand, Policy and Beyond

## **Schedule**

* Long Beach Convention & Entertainment Center, 300 E Ocean Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90802 ([Google Map](https://goo.gl/maps/1N3XGEovGgJqXAV98))
* 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM August 7, 2023 [PDT]

## **Abstract**

In recent years, both academic research and industry applications see an increased effort in using machine learning methods to measure granular causal effects and design optimal policies based on these causal estimates. Open source packages such as [CausalML](https://github.com/uber/causalml) and [EconML](https://github.com/microsoft/econml) provide a unified interface for applied researchers and industry practitioners with a variety of machine learning methods for causal inference. The tutorial will cover the topics including conditional treatment effect estimators by meta-learners and tree-based algorithms, model validations and sensitivity analysis, optimization algorithms including policy leaner and cost optimization. In addition, the tutorial will demonstrate the production of these algorithms in industry use cases.

## **Target Audience for the Workshop**

Anyone who is interested in causal inference and machine learning, especially economists/statisticians/data scientists who want to learn how to combine causal inference and machine learning with real industry use cases incorporated in large scaled machine learning systems at companies such as Microsoft, TripAdvisor and Uber.
The tutorial assumes some basic knowledge in statistical methods, machine learning algorithms and the Python programming language.

## **Invited Speakers**

### Raif Rustamov, Amazon

Video creatives have a substantial impact on consumer experiences and brand perceptions, but evaluating their effect on shopper behavior remains a complex challenge. In this talk, we introduce the Creative Optimality Gap (COG), a novel metric developed using causal-inferential machine learning methodologies to quantify the relative optimality of video creatives. We provide an example application of this approach in assessing the effectiveness of video creatives for brand advertising at Amazon.

### Ruomeng Cui, Emory University

We will provide an overview of CausalML, an open source Python package that provides a suite of uplift modeling and causal inference methods using machine learning algorithms based on recent research. We will introduce the main components of CausalML: (1) inference with causal machine learning algorithms (e.g. meta-learners, uplift trees, CEVAE, dragonnet), (2) validation/analysis methods (e.g. synthetic data generation, AUUC, sensitivity analysis, interpretability), (3) optimization methods (e.g. policy optimization, value optimization, unit selection).

### Luke Skywalker, Stanford University

As an introductory case study for using causal inference, we will cover the use case of understanding the causal impact from observational data in the context of cross sell at Uber. We emphasize that simple comparisons of users who make cross purchase or not will produce biased estimates and that can be demonstrated in the causal inference framework. We show the use of different causal estimation methodologies through propensity score matching and meta learners to estimate the causal impact. In addition, we will use sensitivity analysis to show the robustness of the estimates.

### Princess Leia, Microsoft Research

We will introduce the audience selection method with uplift modeling in online RTB, which aims to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects for advertising. It has been studied to provide a superior return on investment by selecting the most incremental users for a specific campaign. To examine the effectiveness of uplift modeling in the context of real-time bidding, we conducted the comparative analysis of four different meta-learners on real campaign data. We adapted an explore-exploit set up for offline training and online evaluation. We will also introduce how we use Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE) based Average Treatment Effect (ATE) as ground truth for evaluation.
