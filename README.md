# **Causal Inference and Machine Learning in Practice**: Use cases for Product, Brand, Policy and Beyond

## **Schedule**

* Long Beach Convention & Entertainment Center, 300 E Ocean Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90802

* Date: August 7, 2023
* Time: TBD

## **Abstract**

The increasing demand for data-driven decision-making has led to the rapid growth of machine learning applications in
various industries. However, the ability to draw causal inferences from observational data remains a crucial challenge.
In recent years, causal inference has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding the effects of interventions in
complex systems. Combining causal inference with machine learning has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of
the underlying mechanisms and to develop more effective solutions to real-world problems.

This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to share their experiences
and insights on applying causal inference and machine learning techniques to real-world problems in the areas of
product, brand, policy, and beyond. The workshop welcomes original research that covers machine learning theory, deep
learning, causal inference, and online learning. Additionally, the workshop encourages topics that address scalable
system design, algorithm bias, and interpretablility.

Through keynote talks, panel discussions, and contributed talks and posters, the workshop will provide a forum for
discussing the latest advances and challenges in applying causal inference and machine learning to real-world problems.
The workshop will also offer opportunities for networking and collaboration among researchers and practitioners working
in industry, government, and academia.

## **Invited Speakers**

### Raif Rustamov, Amazon

Video creatives have a substantial impact on consumer experiences and brand perceptions, but evaluating their effect on
shopper behavior remains a complex challenge. In this talk, we introduce the Creative Optimality Gap (COG), a novel
metric developed using causal-inferential machine learning methodologies to quantify the relative optimality of video
creatives. We provide an example application of this approach in assessing the effectiveness of video creatives for
brand advertising at Amazon.

### Ruomeng Cui, Emory University

We will provide an overview of CausalML, an open source Python package that provides a suite of uplift modeling and
causal inference methods using machine learning algorithms based on recent research. We will introduce the main
components of CausalML: (1) inference with causal machine learning algorithms (e.g. meta-learners, uplift trees, CEVAE,
dragonnet), (2) validation/analysis methods (e.g. synthetic data generation, AUUC, sensitivity analysis,
interpretability), (3) optimization methods (e.g. policy optimization, value optimization, unit selection).

### Ang Li, University of California, Los Angeles

The unit selection problem aims to identify a set of individuals who are most likely to
exhibit a desired mode of behavior, which is defined in counterfactual terms. A typical
example is that of selecting individuals who would respond one way if encouraged and a
different way if not encouraged. Unlike previous works on this problem, which rely on ad-hoc
heuristics, we approach this problem formally, using counterfactual logic, to properly capture
the nature of the desired behavior. This formalism enables us to derive an informative
selection criterion which integrates experimental and observational data. We show that a
more accurate selection criterion can be achieved when structural information is available
in the form of a causal diagram. We further discuss data availability issue regarding the
derivation of the selection criterion without the observational or experimental data. We
demonstrate the superiority of this criterion over A/B-test-based approaches.
