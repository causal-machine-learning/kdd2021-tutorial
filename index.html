# **Causal Inference and Machine Learning in Practice**: Use cases for Product, Brand, Policy and Beyond

## **Schedule**

* Long Beach Convention & Entertainment Center, 300 E Ocean Blvd, Long Beach, CA 90802 ([Google
Map](https://goo.gl/maps/1N3XGEovGgJqXAV98))
* 9:00 AM - 1:00 PM August 7, 2023 [PDT]

## **Abstract**

In recent years, both academic research and industry applications see an increased effort in using machine learning
methods to measure granular causal effects and design optimal policies based on these causal estimates. Open source
packages such as [CausalML](https://github.com/uber/causalml) and [EconML](https://github.com/microsoft/econml) provide
a unified interface for applied researchers and industry practitioners with a variety of machine learning methods for
causal inference. The tutorial will cover the topics including conditional treatment effect estimators by meta-learners
and tree-based algorithms, model validations and sensitivity analysis, optimization algorithms including policy leaner
and cost optimization. In addition, the tutorial will demonstrate the production of these algorithms in industry use
cases.

## **Target Audience for the Workshop**

Anyone who is interested in causal inference and machine learning, especially economists/statisticians/data scientists
who want to learn how to combine causal inference and machine learning with real industry use cases incorporated in
large scaled machine learning systems at companies such as Microsoft, TripAdvisor and Uber.
The tutorial assumes some basic knowledge in statistical methods, machine learning algorithms and the Python programming
language.

## **Invited Speakers**

### Raif Rustamov, Amazon

Video creatives have a substantial impact on consumer experiences and brand perceptions, but evaluating their effect on
shopper behavior remains a complex challenge. In this talk, we introduce the Creative Optimality Gap (COG), a novel
metric developed using causal-inferential machine learning methodologies to quantify the relative optimality of video
creatives. We provide an example application of this approach in assessing the effectiveness of video creatives for
brand advertising at Amazon.

### Ruomeng Cui, Emory University

We will provide an overview of CausalML, an open source Python package that provides a suite of uplift modeling and
causal inference methods using machine learning algorithms based on recent research. We will introduce the main
components of CausalML: (1) inference with causal machine learning algorithms (e.g. meta-learners, uplift trees, CEVAE,
dragonnet), (2) validation/analysis methods (e.g. synthetic data generation, AUUC, sensitivity analysis,
interpretability), (3) optimization methods (e.g. policy optimization, value optimization, unit selection).

### Ang Li, University of California, Los Angeles

The unit selection problem aims to identify a set of individuals who are most likely to
exhibit a desired mode of behavior, which is defined in counterfactual terms. A typical
example is that of selecting individuals who would respond one way if encouraged and a
different way if not encouraged. Unlike previous works on this problem, which rely on ad-hoc
heuristics, we approach this problem formally, using counterfactual logic, to properly capture
the nature of the desired behavior. This formalism enables us to derive an informative
selection criterion which integrates experimental and observational data. We show that a
more accurate selection criterion can be achieved when structural information is available
in the form of a causal diagram. We further discuss data availability issue regarding the
derivation of the selection criterion without the observational or experimental data. We
demonstrate the superiority of this criterion over A/B-test-based approaches.
