# Auto-convert Jupyter Notebooks To Posts

[`fastpages`](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) will automatically convert [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebooks saved into this directory as blog posts!

You must save your notebook with the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-*.ipynb`.  Examples of valid filenames are:

```shell
2020-01-28-My-First-Post.ipynb
2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.ipynb
```

If you fail to name your file correctly, `fastpages` will automatically attempt to fix the problem by prepending the last modified date of your notebook. However, it is recommended that you name your files properly yourself for more transparency.
