- Your GH-Pages Status badge on your README will eventually appear and be green, indicating your first successful build.
- You can monitor the status of your site in the GitHub Pages section of your [repository settings](https://github.com/{_username_}/{_repo_name_}/settings).

If you are not using a custom domain, your website will appear at: 

#### https://{_username_}.github.io/{_repo_name_}


## Optional: Using a Custom Domain

1. After merging this PR, add a file named `CNAME` at the root of your repo.  For example, the `fastpages` blog is hosted at `https://fastpages.fast.ai`, which means [our CNAME](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages/blob/master/CNAME) contains the following contents: 

        
    >`fastpages.fast.ai`


2. Change the `url` and `baseurl` parameters in your `/_config.yml` file to reflect your custom domain.


    Wondering how to setup a custom domain?  See [this article](https://dev.to/trentyang/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages-1p58).  You must add a CNAME file to the root of your master branch for the intructions in the article to work correctly.
